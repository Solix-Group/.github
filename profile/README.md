*Welcome to the Official Solix Energy - Australia Github Organization*

## Overview

Solix Energy, is an Australian Renewable Energy startup that aims to contribute to a worldwide carbon zero total by 2050. By innovating the manufacturing process of existing and new technologies, we are able to make renewable energy  more affordable. Our range of projects aim to collaborate with eachother to provide all the necassary components for customers where everything is in one place eliminating the need to source additional hardware from external providers. 

Expansion towards scaled up projects is within our interests following the development of urban renewables. Read below for a list of current projects.

## Project Descriptions

Project Title | Description
------------- | --------------
Urban Wind Turbines | This project is focused on the development of a small form factor wind turbine for use in urban environments such as a home or office rooftop.
Solar Technologies | Exploration and development of existing and new solar cell materials to create cheaper and more efficient rooftop solar.
Battery Storage Systems | Exploring new methods of energy storage for urban residencies for solar and wind systems.
Mechanical Batteries | Large kinetic energy retainers, magnetically levitated on superconducting bearings in vaccum chambers for large scale energy storage.
Thermal Sand Storage | Using the thermal insulation properties of sand to store excess renewable energy as heat to be converted back when needed.
ERIS | Electrical Renewable Integration System is a smart inverter to integrate renewable sources into existing grid infrastructure.
Modular Housing | Homes built in modules for drag and drop configuration to create a sustainable and affordable modern living space.
Roadside EV Charging | Roadside fast charging stations to encourage electric vehicle purchases around the world.
